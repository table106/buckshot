alright, so
there's a shotgun
every time it is empty we load some shells in
they can be blank or live, and will be in a random sequence
you only get the numbers though!
every turn, you use the shotgun
you point it either at yourself, or a rival
if you shoot yourself with a blank you get to go again!

ITEMS (from round 2 onwards)

-beer:
you eject the round in the chamber from the shotgun, if its the last one we reload it

-knife:
you saw the barrel of the shotgun, making the next shot deal 2 damage (the barrel regenerates after the turn)

-magnifying glass:
you look into the chamber, revealing the shell inside

-cigarette:
you regain a life (smoking is bad kids dont do it)

-cuffs:
you cuff a rival skipping their next turn (doesnt stack)

ALSO: you can type '..' at (almost) any time to go to the previous screen
